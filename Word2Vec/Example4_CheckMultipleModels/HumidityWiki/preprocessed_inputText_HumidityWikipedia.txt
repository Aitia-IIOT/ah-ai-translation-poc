words relative humidity ratio much water vapour air much water vapour air could potentially contain given temperature varies temperature air colder air contain less vapour water tend condense air lower temperatures changing temperature air change relative humidity even absolute humidity remains constant

air actually hold water vapour concept relative humidity quite separate chemical reactions going water vapour gasses chemistry aside condensation evaporation independent composition air changes temperature

chilling air increases relative humidity cause water vapour condense relative humidity rises 100 dew point likewise warming air decreases relative humidity warming air containing fog may cause fog evaporate droplets prone total evaporation due heat

relative humidity considers invisible water vapour mists clouds fogs aerosols water count towards measure relative humidity air although presence indication body air may close dew point

relative humidity normally expressed percentage higher percentage means air–water mixture humid 100 relative humidity air saturated dew point absence foreign body droplets crystals nucleate relative humidity exceed 100 case air said supersaturated introduction particles surface body air 100 relative humidity allow condensation ice form nuclei thereby removing vapour lowering humidity

humidity depends water vaporization condensation turn mainly depends temperature therefore applying pressure gas saturated water components initially decrease volume approximately according ideal gas law however water condense returning almost humidity giving resulting total volume deviating ideal gas law predicted

conversely decreasing temperature would also make water condense making final volume deviate predicted ideal gas law therefore gas volume may alternatively expressed dry volume excluding humidity content fraction accurately follows ideal gas law contrary saturated volume volume gas mixture would humidity added saturation 100 relative humidity

gas given temperature pressure number molecules present particular volume constant therefore number n water molecules vapor introduced volume dry air number air molecules volume must decrease number n pressure remain constant without using change temperature numbers exactly equal consider gases ideal addition water molecules molecules gas without removal equal number molecules necessarily require change temperature pressure total volume change least one three parameters

temperature pressure remain constant volume increases dry air molecules displaced initially move additional volume mixture eventually become uniform diffusion hence mass per unit volume gas—its density—decreases isaac newton discovered phenomenon wrote book

relative humidity air–water system dependent temperature also absolute pressure system interest dependence demonstrated considering air–water system shown system closed ie matter enters leaves system

system state isobarically heated heating change system pressure relative humidity system decreases equilibrium vapor pressure water increases increasing temperature shown state b

system state isothermally compressed compressed change system temperature relative humidity system increases partial pressure water system increases volume reduction 20264 kpa rh would exceed 100 water may begin condense

pressure state changed simply adding dry air without changing volume relative humidity would change

therefore change relative humidity explained change system temperature change volume system change system properties
